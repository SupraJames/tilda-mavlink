# tilda-mavlink

Mavlink message decoding on the Tilda MKe

Takes mavlink messages from the on board serial UART, decodes them, and displays them on the LCD. The messages can come straight from an autopilot modules, or a telemetry system like the 3DR radios, and clones.

I'm afraid there is not much here yet :)

This small project is based on the Tilda MKE, an Arduino Due like board with an LCD, from EMF Camp 2014
See https://badge.emfcamp.org/wiki/TiLDA_MKe for more details about the hardware.
